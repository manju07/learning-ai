- AI is making the system as intelligent as human as.


- ML is subset of AI
- How ML works? 
    - Use existing data to train the model
    - Build model
    - Use model to predict the output

- Input == Features - Required to predict the output
- Ouput == Label - Based on features, predicting the label with the help of model 

- Example Models:
    - House pricing prediction model(Regression) :
        - Label: Price
        - Features: area, rooms, kitchen, balcony and near by places

    - User car pricing model(Regression)
    - Spam email model(Classision)
    - Provide loan model (Classision)

- Prediction possibilities of Label
    - Regression Model: If label is a number with a range
    - Classision: If label fall under set of predefined values.


- Creating ML Models
    - Obtain data
    - Clean data
    - Feature Engineering: Find all Features and Label
    - Create model with ML algorithm
    - Evaluate the accuracy of the prediction
    - Deploy the model
